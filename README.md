Electricity Bill Calculator
This is a C programming project that calculates electricity bills based on tiered pricing structures. The program implements a progressive billing system where the cost per unit increases as consumption rises.
Pricing Structure-
0-50 units: Rs. 0.50 per unit
51-150 units: First 50 at Rs. 0.50, remaining at Rs. 0.75 per unit
151-250 units: First 50 at Rs. 0.50, next 100 at Rs. 0.75, remaining at Rs. 1.20 per unit
Above 250 units: First 50 at Rs. 0.50, next 100 at Rs. 0.75, next 100 at Rs. 1.20, remaining at Rs. 1.50 per unit
Additional Charges: Rs. 20.00 (fixed)

Technical Specifications
Language: C
Input: Number of units consumed (integer)
Output: Detailed bill breakdown showing units, bill amount, additional charges, and total bill
Logic: Conditional statements (if-else ladder) for tier-based calculation

Utility
This project serves multiple practical purposes:

Real-world Application: Simulates actual electricity billing systems used by utility companies
Consumer Awareness: Helps users understand how progressive billing works and plan their consumption
Cost Estimation: Allows consumers to estimate their electricity bills before receiving the actual bill
Educational Tool: Demonstrates practical implementation of mathematical calculations and conditional logic in programming
Foundation for Larger Systems: Can be integrated into larger utility management systems or mobile applications

Future Scope
The project can be enhanced with a graphical user interface, database integration for billing history, dynamic pricing management, payment gateway integration, consumption trend analysis, multiple tariff plans, and mobile application development.
Need for This Project
This project addresses several important needs:

Transparency:
Many consumers don't understand how their electricity bills are calculated. This project provides clarity on the tiered pricing model.
Educational Value: Teaches the concept of progressive pricing.
Programming Practice: Provides a practical scenario for learning conditional statements and mathematical operations in C.

What This Project Taught Me
Through developing this project, I gained valuable insights and skills:
Learned if-else conditions, using int and float variables, doing calculations, and taking user input and showing output.
Learned to break big problems into small parts, handle different cases, and think step by step.
Utility Billing Systems: Gained insight into how real-world billing systems work.
Progressive Pricing: Understood the concept and purpose of tiered pricing structures.
Consumer Perspective: Appreciated the importance of transparent billing for end users.
Documentation: Recognized the importance of clear documentation (like this README).
Understood that simple projects can be foundations for larger, more complex systems.
